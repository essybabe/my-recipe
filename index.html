    <h1>EGUSI SOUP</h1>
    <p>Egusi soup is very popular across West Africa. It is prepared from ground egusi melon seed and typically cooked with meat or fish and leafy vegetables. The recipe I am sharing here is for easy and tasty Nigerian egusi soup, also known as “efo elegusi”, in Yoruba language. It is a version of egusi soup cooked with leafy vegetables.  

        Efo elegusi is traditionally eaten with foods “swallow” like eba, fufu, iyan (pounded yam) etc. It is also a great accompaniment to rice, yam and plantain.

        <h3>METHOD ON HOW TO PREPARE EGUSI SOUP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blend red bell pepper, scotch bonnet pepper, tomatoes and one onion in a food processor with &nbsp;a cup of water.</li>
            <li>chop the remaining onion. Cut the smoked mackerel fillets into smaller pieces. Keep to one side.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan for &nbsp; 30 secs, add the chopped onions. Fry until the onions appear translucent, then add the locust beans. Stir for one minute to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Add the blended pepper mix and leave to cook for around &nbsp; 15 mins, stirring occasionally, then add some water into the pot &nbsp;(3-4 cups). Pour in the dried fish and ground crayfish with some a little salt to taste. Smoked mackerel is salty, and will make the soup more salty, so make allowance for that. Leave to simmer for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Take 2 tablespoons of the cooking sauce and add into the egusi. Mix well to make a thick paste. Use your hands to make small egusi balls before dropping into the pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat and allow to cook for at least &nbsp; 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Mix in kale and smoked mackerel. If you think the soup is too thick, add some more water. Leave to simmer for &nbsp;10 mins, still under low heat.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve.</li>
        </ul>
